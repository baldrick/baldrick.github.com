The other night I wanted to watch a little YouTube in bed.  But M wanted to sleep.  So I cracked out the earphones for the first time in an age.  And found they wouldn't go into the headphone socket.  Hmm.  Weird.  A job for the weekend then.

Into the shed with some strong light ... and I can definitely see something in there.  But how to get it out.  Drill bits go nowhere (by hand - I'm not risking an electric drill here :smile:).  Fortunately though the sharp end of a screw (in a pair of pliers) shattered whatever it was so I could tap it out.

A couple more scratches, shatters and taps allows me to relax - the socket is now empty and headphones work as promised.  At this point I'm wondering what kids' toys would fit.  And _why_ they'd put anything in there.  A discussion for another day perhaps.

The next week ... the same thing.  This time the bits came out a bit more easily.  But investigation was clearly required. 

So where had they come from?  After a lightbulb moment I wondered ... my rucksack.  Wasn't there a bag or two of silica gel in there?  Aha.  Yes, there _was_ ... and it had burst so there were little balls swimming around at the bottom of my rucksack.

And it seems silica balls are _exactly_ the right size to easily slide into a 3.5mm headphone socket and absolutely refuse to come out.

Grr.
