# The DR Shed

Since the lockdown started I've been working from home in my shed.  I set up a couple of old monitors and an old PC a couple of years ago with the idea I'd edit some videos there.  Needless to say I've done none of that ... but it's come in danm handy over the last couple of months.

I improved the setup in the first couple of weeks by:
* putting the monitors on wall mounts (more space on my small desk)
* installing [a new keyboard](https://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/ultra-classic-ibm-style-keyboard-black-usb.asp) (I've always wanted to try one of these but they're seriously too loud for a shared office or even my house!)
* ... and [mouse replacement](https://www.kensington.com/en-gb/p/products/ergonomics/ergonomic-input-devices/slimblade-trackball/) to help with the tennis elbow (yes, it's worked ... a bit)

All was going swimmingly ... until it wasn't.  One Friday morning the PC appeared to be on (lights were lit, fans spinning) but not even the POST screen came up.  Damn.  My Mac won't connect to work (because it's on Catalina - seemingly unsupported!) and it's no fun trying to work on my gaming PC in the lair (a projector screen is no good for text).

What to do...  I _could_ order a NUC, we've got one of those in the spare room and it's terrific for a silent WFH experience.  No fans.  No spinning disks.  Ideal.  But I didn't want that.  I wanted to build a PC to my own spec and am prepared to put up with a bit of noise in the shed (my keyboard + neighbour's gardening machinery drown out the fans!) so I hatched a plan.

Stage 1: move the gaming PC to the shed so I can work ASAP.
Stage 2: research new PC.
Stage 3: order parts.
Stage 4: build it.
Stage 5: refine.

# The Clear Out

As a result I have some bits and pieces that may or may not work.

* Gigabyte motherboard
* Corsair 6 * 2Gb DDR3
* Intel CPU (can't recall what)
* [Megahalems heatsink](http://www.prolimatech.com/en/products/detail.asp?id=2148&subid=2211) (I don't know if it's this exact version but it's v similar)
* [Zotac GTX-285](https://www.zotac.com/au/product/graphics_card/gtx285)
* Internal DVD player (writer?) with IDE connectivity (I'll throw in a couple of IDE cables)

... let me know how much you'd like to donate to charity and we'll arrange something at least partly based on how well it still works (the Netgear managed hubs work perfectly & are great, the Asus RT kit is the stuff that started going wrong but is probably still good enough for a non-hot area).  Alternatively, if anyone knows of a charity that would like them, well, please let me know.  If you don't know what they are, you probably don't need them.
