Einstein's [Special Theory of Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) tells us, as far as this simplistic author is concerned, that [time slows down the faster you go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity#Time_dilation).  No it's not that simple.  But it'll do for the purposes of this post.

What the theory *doesn't* say is anything about what happens to time when you're in the gym.

Over the last few months I've forced myself to hand over inordinate amounts of cash for someone else to tell me what to do.  That could be taken out of context I guess...  The context here though is gym work.  And it's the only way I ever make it to the gym.  Which is the only way I stand any chance of getting fitter in order to play squash more effectively.

It's worked.  To some extent.  A combination of drinking more water, more focus on warming up and aforementioned gym work has meant I can play squash yet incur fewer injuries.  And I'm playing more than I used to and against better opponents.  All good.

But what's this got to do with relativity?

The routines set out for me incude some exercises I don't like.  Don't get me wrong, they all require effort.  But I'm convinced some are only present to sate the instructor's sadistic streak.  Must be.  Like swinging a kettle bell.  Bleurgh.

Some of the exercises are done a certain number of times.  Others done against the clock.  Thirty seconds of this.  Sixty seconds of that.

The thing is I swear the exercises I find most difficult or least satisfying make time slow down.  For example when doing [the plank](http://www.wikihow.com/Perform-the-Plank-Exercise) I put my watch on the floor and try not to look at it.  Twenty minutes later the second hand has advanced several seconds.  Hang on, wtf.  I swear I end up planking for what feels like hours.  It's only sixty seconds at a stretch.  But it *feels* much longer.

So.  There you go: gym work has relativistic effects.
