Another post that's been languishing in the drafts folder throughout 2015...  Tidied up a bit and whacked out!

# Choices, choices...

I love gadgets.  But I don't like parting with the hard-earned so I have a couple of choices:

1. Steal
2. Research

I don't fancy incarceration and I'll generally admit if I get long-changed so the first option isn't really an option.

# Research

Both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because more often than not I end up very happy with purchases I make.  A curse because I can easily spend more time researching something than I'm likely to end up using whatever it is I'm thinking of buying.

Ok, that's exaggerating.  Slightly.

Internet reviews.  Blogs.  *Trusted* sites.  I'll search out and read the lot.

# The mantra

I've no idea if this is an attributable quote.  If not, I claim ownership :-)  I've rarely regretted ponying up for a high quality item as they tend to last, they're more satisfying in use, and are often more fixable.

Technology can be a frustrating exception to this as the pace of change is such that buying not-quite-top-end, but slightly more often, can be a better bet than the Rolls Royce option.

# Phones

I only bought a smartphone in late 2010 as impending building work meant I thought I'd want to take photos of stuff we may need to show my better half before making a decision.

It was a reasonable phone for the time (an [HTC Desire](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire-3077.php)) and proved its usefulness but lack of storage space held it back from long-term adoration.  And, IMHO, 3G internet is so slow it's almost worse than no internet so I barely ever used it.

I finally decided to replace it in late 2014.  Which meant more research.

Hmm, everything's got BIG.  The [iPhone6](https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-6/) was due out soon but, although I love my iPad, I prefer Android because it's so much cheaper.

## Cheaper

I'm lucky enough to have the cashflow to buy a phone outright and have the cheapest possible plan afterwards.  No forty-quid-a-month locked-in-for-two-years plans for me.

In the end buying up front is at least a couple of hundred quid cheaper and more if you forget to change plans after the lock-in period.  Which I would.

I can't bring myself to shell out four or five hundred quid on a phone though.  Just doesn't seem like good value for me.

## Androids

The [Nexus 5](http://www.google.co.uk/nexus/5/) seemed to have it all ... but was soon to be replaced by the [Nexus 6/X/whatever-it-was-going-to-be-called](http://www.google.co.uk/nexus/6/) and unavailable (in black 32Gb form) from google's store.  The [OnePlus](https://oneplus.net) was also an attractive option but near impossible to buy with it's annoying invite-only scheme.

Fortunately someone at work had a OnePlus and a quick try in my hands confirmed it to be too big for my needs / pockets.  A try with a [MotoG](http://www.motorola.com/us/moto-g-pdp-1/Moto-G-1st-Gen./moto-g-pdp.html) (almost the same size as the Nexus 5) was more successful.

In the end I bought what I guess is one of the last Nexus 5's available.  Black.  32Gb.  Vanilla Android.

The research paid off: it's the ideal phone for me.

Almost too large (the compromise I accepted), enough storage and fast.  A revelation compared to the old HTC.

I really rather like the what-seemed-like-a-gadget wireless charging (which is a bit of luck as the only serious disadvantage of this phone is its weedy battery - it only just gets me through a day of moderate use).
