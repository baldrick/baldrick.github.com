Ok, not so much a history of computing, more a history of _my_ computing :smile:

I don't know what inspired my parents but they bought me one of these when I was ... let's just say _young_.

I still have the box and power supply.  Somewhere I've got the dedicated tape drive.  There are also a selection of (cartridge) games.  The tape-based games are probably hanging around in a box somewhere too but I imagine they'd load even less reliably than they did when new...  As you can see from the box, the Vic20 was a beast.  Colour _and_ sound & music!

Changing colours or making sounds was a simple matter of poking a value into an address.  e.g. `poke 36879,7` would make the screen go blue.  Other addresses would change the border colour, make sounds or even alter character shape (to call it a _font_ is a bit of a stretch but I recall designing my own character sets on paper then poking memory to change what I saw on screen).  Yes <a href="http://www.1000bit.it/support/manuali/commodore/vic20/A_Beginners_Guide_to_Real_Programming_Discover_your_VIC-20.pdf">I had to cheat a bit</a> to remember some of this!

The Vic came with a full 3&frac12;K RAM but some games, unbelievably, needed more.  Numerous devices were available to pump up the memory and at some point I (ok, my parents) settled on the _Vixen_...

Some games couldn't cope with the heady heights of 19&frac12;K RAM hence the dip-switches allowing 2K, 4K, 8K or 16K to be presented to the machine.

My next computer, a few years later, was an Amstrad CPC-464:

Oh the might of 64K RAM and, delight of delights, a built-in tape drive - somehow far more reliable than the Vic20's dedicated offering (that was itself still far more reliable than a friend's drive attached to his Speccy).  Over the years I built up a collection of accessories bought from a number of computer shows.  I remember a <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Dk%27tronics_Speech_Synthesizer">speech synth</a> (which was, as you might imagine, pretty unintelligible) and a _Multiface2_ which allowed games to be paused (and saved) at any point.  My favourite though was the three inch disk drive ... oh the speed!  The <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Amstrad/Schneider_DMP2000_Printer">DMP2000</a> was a close second - many homeworks were typed rather than written, teachers only complained when the ribbon got low on ink and the print was, umm, a bit faint :smile:

Move forward in time and university beckoned.  The Amstrad plainly wouldn't cut it so some research was in order.  If I have any younger readers let me explain what this meant.  (pedants look away) The internet basically didn't exist at this time so _research_ meant reading bits of paper stapled together; such _magazines_ were typically published weekly or monthly.

Since I was taking a Computer Science course I needed some form of _IBM PC_.  But I also wanted something that would play games.  An Amiga A2000 with 286 bridge board beckoned - the best of both worlds.  Fortunately these were also subject to educational grants so I got a very significant discount (60% if memory serves) ... even so it still meant spending my entire inheritance from an aunt.  A good investment I reckon.

You may just about be able to make out the sixteen RAM chips I inserted - weirdly this RAM expansion was made possible by the hard disk drive interface card (first on the left of the twin 3.5" floppy drives) so not only did I get an extra 2Mb memory (making a heady total of 3Mb) but I also benefited from a gigantic 40Mb hard drive.  Further left is the 286 bridge board, hooked up to the 5&frac14;" floppy drive, followed by what I think is a video card.  There's also a cable (my first adventures in soldering, no you can't have a close-up) to a joystick/mouse switching device...

Which reminds me.  In reality my favourite accessory was my joystick.  No sniggering at the back.  I went through a few models but the one that lasted the longest (they never normally lasted more than a couple of years, this _still_ works) is the Konix Speedking.
