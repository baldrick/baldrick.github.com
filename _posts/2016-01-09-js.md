The final draft to finally finish.  This one was started about nine months ago...  And finally a tech-focussed post!

# &

I've never been a web programmer.  At least not in the *real* sense of the word.

That's a gap I didn't like but, until a couple of years ago, no problem presented itself requiring me to become one...

# node

Until one did.  A simple project at work that meant I could solve a problem (for the entire company, not just my department) *and* learn some form of web programming.  A quick introduction to [<form>](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp) from my father-in-law and I was off ... this stuff's easier than expected :smirk:

I'd heard a lot about [node.js](https://nodejs.org) being the daddy so I thought I'd try it out.  Which meant learning [javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) - an apparently invaluable tool for client-side web apps that's now invaluable for the server-side too.

# Browser hell

OMG in many ways I'm glad I came late to this party.  Not all browsers are created equal.  Especially IE.  What a mess.  Thankfully being late means there are a number of frameworks that help plaster over the cracks of incompatibility...

# A different approach

<img src="/images/async.jpg" align="right" width="200px">

One of the claimed benefits of node.js is its speed.  And it derives that from its single-threaded nature.  A good old event loop then...

It feels counterintuitive that a single thread should be faster than multiple threads.  As ever though it's a case of *horses for courses*.  Work that can be efficiently broken up into a well-known number of isolated tasks is likely to be faster using a multi-threaded model.  But if we're dealing with an unknown number of tasks that may contend for the same resource, there are benefits to single-threading since CPUs (like many humans) find context-switching expensive.

That means a different approach to programming - asynchronous.  I find that does require a certain amount of mental acrobatics but I like the implied efficiency: if one user's session is waiting on I/O the thread will continue processing other sessions.  From what I've read, this approach is so much more efficient, node.js can deal with thousands more sessions than the thread-per-session or similar approaches of Apache / IIS.  I haven't done any load testing so can't confirm or deny my reality ... but gut feel is good :wink:

# Editing...

Yes, you *can* use vi.  And I do when that's all there is.  But I *prefer* not to...  And I've never really got on with [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) although I can't help but feel that's a bit of a hole in my claim to geekdom.  Just as all geeks should know _at least enough_ *nix to get by, that means knowing vi.  Tick.  But emacs falls into that camp too ... you ought to know _at least enough_.

I started my javascript journey with [TextPad](https://www.textpad.com).  I'm used to it and it does *enough*.  Then I tried [sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) which is also *fine*.  Then I thought I'd challenge the habit of a lifetime and buy some software :open_mouth: ... so of course a free trial beckoned.  I'd read good things about [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and after the trial I decided it was worth the Â£39 asking price even though debugging (an expected mainstay of an IDE) isn't brilliant :weary:

# Current state

I love node for small projects.  It's very easy to get something up & running quickly.  And there's a good ecosystems of components to re-use (and its dependency management, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), is great).  Although many don't have good documentation, pretty much all are open source so it's not that hard to find a likely candidate when searching for a specific method :smile:

However.  I'm not sure I'd use it for _large_ projects.  For some definition of large.

If you've got a collection of microservices and you've got deployment down to an automated fine-art then node could suffice.  I've proved a zero downtime deployment approach with node (pretty trivial for my imperfect but _good enough_ example).

But javascript with a team of dozens of people?  I dunno.  But then I'm not a fan of large teams anyway ... [two pizza teams](http://blog.idonethis.com/two-pizza-team/) work well with java, perhaps they'd work well with javascript too :smile:  Certainly the monolithic apps I've seen would be an even bigger disaster with javascript.

The main reason I feel this way is the lack of type checking.  _using strict_ helps a bit but there are still run-time issues I find related to type or, more often, inconsistently named variables (which, tbh, is also why javascript is so flexible).  Perhaps ES6 or TypeScript would help.

Of course automated testing goes a long way to alleviate this problem too.  I've played with [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and rather like it...

Oh and before you ask, I'm not a fan of coffee.  Nor [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) particularly.  Probably just a lack of familiarity (because it _does_ bring attractive brevity) but, for now, it can stay that way.
