# 2019 reading list

Following on from [2014](/learning/2015/02/01/bookworm), [2015](/learning/2015/12/31/bookworm2), [2016](/learning/2015/12/31/bookworm3), [2017](/learning/2017/12/31/bookworm4) and [2018](/learning/2019/01/12/bookworm5) although this year I won't bother keeping track of how long I take to read each book - it's not worth the effort.

The _Cost_ column shows whether it's available :free: on Kindle Unlimited followed by how much you'd pay for the Kindle version and finally the cheapest physical version at time of writing :smile:

# Kindle Unlimited

We've really not been taking advantage of Kindle Unlimited this year.  The books I've been reading aren't available on it.  The kids don't ask for it.  Nor does my wife.  So I cancelled it on 24th November.  Naturally this was two days _after_ paying for the next month so we had it until 22nd December.  When cancelling I got an offer of three months for the price of one which was only semi-tempting, only took a few seconds to decide not to take advantage of it.

Kindle Unlimited in 2019 saved us £16 but it's cost £8/month - £88 spent in 2019 up to cancellation.  Overall having it for the last three years has cost us £67 over just buying the books we read: 2017 saw £50 saved but 2018 cost £45 and this year cost £72.

Having a Kindle though is still worthwhile.  Not only because it's cheaper (~£40 saved in 2019 vs. physical books) but also doesn't require me to store books I'll probably never read again and is [_probably_ more eco-friendly](https://www.cnet.com/news/study-paints-kindle-e-reader-a-dark-shade-of-green/).  AND of course I can, signal notwithstanding, download books on the move - more useful for the commute than I'd envisaged.  AND reading at night is less annoying for SWMBO.
