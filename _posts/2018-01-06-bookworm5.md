# 2018 reading list
Following on from [2014](/learning/2015/02/01/bookworm), [2015](/learning/2015/12/31/bookworm2), [2016](/learning/2015/12/31/bookworm3) and [2017](/learning/2017/12/31/bookworm4).

I found, too late, the addition of icons to last year's blog made it a bit unreadable for my tastes.  I've therefore switched to a table format - it's a bit more effort to create but I think the end result is much cleaner which makes it worthwhile.

The _Cost_ column shows whether it's available :free: on Kindle Unlimited followed by how much you'd pay for the Kindle version and finally the cheapest physical version at time of writing :smile:

I've also added a _Time_ column in an effort to gauge how long I spend reading a given book.  In general I have a 30 minute commute so probably 25 minutes' reading time each way per day...  How much I read outside those times is determined by how good the book is :wink:

I started cycling to work in July (I reckon I manage 2-3 times per week on average) thus removing a lot of reading time; I've marked any books affected with :bicyclist:

### Key

Unless stated otherwise, I read all these books on my Kindle and prices are once more included to see whether Kindle Unlimited is worth it.  Another advantage of the Kindle is that you can download a free sample before you buy.  I did this a bit more regularly this year so will include books I sampled but didn't buy.
