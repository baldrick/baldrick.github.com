I've never been a web programmer.  At least not in the *real* sense of the word.

That's a gap I didn't like but, until a couple of years ago, no problem presented itself requiring me to become one...

# node

Until one did.  A simple project at work that meant I could solve a problem (for the entire company, not just my department) *and* learn some form of web programming.  A quick introduction to [<form>](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp) from my father-in-law and I was off ... this stuff's easier than expected :smirk:

I'd heard a lot about [node.js](https://nodejs.org) being the daddy so I thought I'd try it out.  Which meant learning [javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) - an apparently invaluable tool for client-side web apps that's now invaluable for the server-side too.

# Browser hell

OMG in many ways I'm glad I came late to this party.  Not all browsers are created equal.  Especially IE.  What a mess.  Thankfully being late means there are a number of frameworks that help plaster over the cracks of incompatibility...

# A different approach

<img src="/images/async.jpg" align="right" class="frameit" width="200px">

One of the claimed benefits of node.js is its speed.  And it derives that from its single-threaded nature.  A good old event loop then...

It feels counterintuitive that a single thread should be faster than multiple threads.  As ever though it's a case of *horses for courses*.  Work that can be efficiently broken up into a well-known number of isolated tasks is likely to be faster using a multi-threaded model.  But if we're dealing with an unknown number of tasks that may contend for the same resource, there are benefits to single-threading for CPUs (like many humans) find context-switching expensive.

That means a different approach to programming - asynchronous.  I find that does require a certain amount of mental acrobatics but I like the implied efficiency: if one user's session is waiting on I/O the thread will continue processing other sessions.  From what I've read, this approach is so much more efficient node.js can deal with thousands more sessions than the thread-per-session or similar approaches of Apache / IIS.  I haven't done any load testing so can't confirm or deny my reality ... but gut feel is good :wink:

# Editing...

Yes, you *can* use vi.  And I do when that's all there is.  But I *prefer* not to...

I started my javascript journey with [TextPad](https://www.textpad.com).  I'm used to it and it does *enough*.  Then I tried [sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) which is also *fine*.  Then I thought I'd challenge the habit of a lifetime and buy some software :open_mouth: ... so of course a free trial beckoned.  I'd read good things about [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and after the trial I decided it was worth the Â£39 asking price even though debugging (an expected mainstay of an IDE) isn't brilliant :weary:
