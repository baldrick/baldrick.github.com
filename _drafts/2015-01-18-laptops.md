# Buy cheap, buy twice

The laptop I'm typing on is a good example of why buying cheap is a bad idea.

It's an [HP tx2](http://www.cnet.com/products/hp-touchsmart-tx2-1275dx/) bought (almost) on a whim because it was on sale and I'd wanted a touchscreen laptop for a while.

I've never really liked it.  A couple of keys (vaguely important ones like shift & space) don't work well, the fans are noisy, it gets hot, and it's heavy.

Replacing its spinning rust with an SSD gave it a new lease of life a year or so ago but I'm getting fed up with it now...

# Replacement?

I'd **like** a laptop with specs along these lines:

- light (around 1.3kg I reckon)
- thin (MacBook Air sort of size)
- 13" Full HD fold-flat touchscreen is likely all I need
- decent backlit keyboard with non-annoying layout
- 8Gb RAM
- SSD (reckon 256Gb is enough)
- Core i5 probably good enough, don't know if I'd notice speed improvement of i7
- >=4 hours battery life (longer is always better, obviously)

I don't need:

- gaming performance
- hybrid becomes-a-tablet functionality
- a glossy works-like-a-mirror screen
