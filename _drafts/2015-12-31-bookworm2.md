# 2015 reading list
I tried to edit this post every time I finished a book so this is a rather more complete list than [the one from 2014](/learning/2015/02/01/bookworm).  And ordered.  But that still hardly matters...

* [Zero to One](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Start-Future-ebook/dp/B00KHX0II4/ref=pd_sim_b_10?ie=UTF8&refRID=010DRYF5M966WF0FPFPN) - Peter Thiel
  * An easy short read about startups and VCs.
* [The Year Without Pants](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-Com-Hardcover/dp/B00GOH3D34/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1422128167&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=the+year+without+pants) - Scott Burken
  * An interesting account of how a different approach to running a company can work.
* [The Art of Possibility](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Hardcover/dp/B00GSCMDRW/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422128361&sr=1-2&keywords=the+art+of+the+possibility) - Roz & Ben Zander
  * A slow read for me (interrupted by Zero to One), perhaps a bit poetic/fluffy for my tastes but has some interesting stories and insights to improve one's outlook on life.
* [Think like a freak](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Freak-Smarter-Everything/dp/1846147557) - Stephen J. Dubner & Steven D. Lewitt
  * Excellent, may need to re-read [Superfreakonomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Superfreakonomics-Cooling-Patriotic-Prostitutes-Insurance/dp/0141030704/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y).  I wonder if it's worth reading [Freakonomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0141019018/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) too...
* [It's not how good you are, It's how good you want to be](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1423090505&sr=8-9&keywords=be+who+you+want+to+be) - Paul Arden
  * A one-day read.  Entertaining advice for the brave...
* [Wool, Shift, Dust trilogy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wool-Trilogy-Shift-Dust-ebook/dp/B00I96357W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1427043593&sr=8-2&keywords=wool%2C+shift%2C+dust) - Hugh Howey
  * Recommended by Robin after [last year's post about reading]((/learning/2015/02/01/bookworm) and I thank him for it (and the suggestion about [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com) and the e-loan of the first two)...  A highly enjoyable story about a rather dystopian future.  FWIW I disagree with those reviewers complaining about loose ends not being tied off at the end of the trilogy.
