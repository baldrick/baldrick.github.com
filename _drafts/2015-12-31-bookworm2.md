# 2015 reading list
I tried to edit this post every time I finished a book so this is a rather more complete list than [the one from 2014](/learning/2015/02/01/bookworm).  And ordered.  But that still hardly matters...

* [Zero to One](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-One-Notes-Start-Future-ebook/dp/B00KHX0II4/ref=pd_sim_b_10?ie=UTF8&refRID=010DRYF5M966WF0FPFPN) - Peter Thiel
  * An easy short read about startups and VCs.
* [The Year Without Pants](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-Com-Hardcover/dp/B00GOH3D34/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1422128167&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=the+year+without+pants) - Scott Burken
  * An interesting account of how a different approach to running a company can work.
* [The Art of Possibility](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Hardcover/dp/B00GSCMDRW/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422128361&sr=1-2&keywords=the+art+of+the+possibility) - Roz & Ben Zander
  * A slow read for me (interrupted by Zero to One), perhaps a bit poetic/fluffy for my tastes but has some interesting stories and insights to improve one's outlook on life.
* [Think like a freak](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Freak-Smarter-Everything/dp/1846147557) - Stephen J. Dubner & Steven D. Lewitt
  * Excellent, may need to re-read [Superfreakonomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Superfreakonomics-Cooling-Patriotic-Prostitutes-Insurance/dp/0141030704/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y).  I wonder if it's worth reading [Freakonomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0141019018/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) too...
* [It's not how good you are, It's how good you want to be](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1423090505&sr=8-9&keywords=be+who+you+want+to+be) - Paul Arden
  * A one-day read.  Entertaining advice for the brave...
* [Wool, Shift, Dust trilogy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wool-Trilogy-Shift-Dust-ebook/dp/B00I96357W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1427043593&sr=8-2&keywords=wool%2C+shift%2C+dust) - Hugh Howey
  * Recommended by Robin after [last year's post about reading]((/learning/2015/02/01/bookworm) and I thank him for it (and the suggestion about [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com) and the e-loan of the first two)...  A highly enjoyable story of a rather dystopian future.  FWIW I disagree with those reviewers complaining about loose ends not being tied off at the end of the trilogy.
* [Altered Carbon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Altered-Carbon-GOLLANCZ-Richard-Morgan/dp/0575081244) - Richard Morgan
  * Another of Robin's recommendations and definitely worth a read.  Sleeves take on a whole new meaning.
* [Revelation Space](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Revelation-Space-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0575083093/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428312406&sr=8-1&keywords=revelation+space) - Alastair Reynolds
  * The final of Robin's three recommendations and the one I felt was slowest to get going, I really didn't feel _into_ the story until about page 125...  But it turned out to be a great story after all :smile:
* [The End of Eternity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Eternity-Panther-Science-Fiction/dp/0586024409/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431643224&sr=1-1&keywords=end+eternity) - Isaac Asimov
  * Somehow I found an Asimov story I hadn't read...  Glad I did, it's up to his usual legendary standard.  I do enjoy a time travel story...
* [Freakonomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything-ebook/dp/B002RPCOH8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431643374&sr=1-1&keywords=freakonomics) - Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner
  * The book that started a series and somehow it's the final one I've read ... thought provoking.  Well worth the week or so it took to read.
* [The Great Train Robbery](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Train-Robbery-Michael-Crichton/dp/009948241X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432588554&sr=1-2&keywords=the+great+train+robbery) - Michael Crichton
  * One of only a couple of Michael Crichton books I haven't read.  Different to the others but well worth a read.
* [Eaters of the Dead](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eaters-Dead-Michael-Crichton/dp/0099222825/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433454460&sr=8-1&keywords=eaters+of+the+dead) - Michael Crichton
  * The other Michael Crichton I haven't read.  I really like most of his books.  If I'd started with this one I may not have read any of the others.  Beowulf type story that just didn't grab me.  Gave up having got not quite halfway.
* [The Chimp Paradox](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chimp-Paradox-Management-Programme-Confidence/dp/009193558X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433454488&sr=1-1&keywords=the+chimp+paradox) - Prof. Steve Peters
  * ...
* [Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is shaping our Future](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elon-Musk-Billionaire-SpaceX-shaping/dp/075355562X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1434402586&sr=1-1&keywords=elon+musk) - Ashlee Vance
  * Elon is clearly something of a genius.  And a Royal Pain In The Ar*e to work for.  This book is a must read.  I want a Tesla :smile:
